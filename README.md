# pareidolia-in-clouds

In this project "Pareidolia in Clouds" we aim to model pattern abstractions that cannot be inherently modeled by mathematical equations. By focusing on learning patterns in clouds we aim to learn latent pattern representations in a creative fashion. We will be using CLIPasso as our backbone which will enable us to abstract sketch like representations of the cloud images. We will be focusing on finding animal images within the clouds. One of the parts we explored in depth was generating cloud like images of animals since there does not exist an extensive cloud database to train on. Our results show that it is possible to learn patterns in clouds that might not be obvious.
